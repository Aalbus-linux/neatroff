NEATROFF
========

Neatroff is an implementation of troff typesetting system in
C programming language.  Neatroff comes with its own postscript
postprocessor, neatpost.  Neatroff and neatpost can be obtained
from the following addresses:

* Neatroff: git://repo.or.cz/neatroff.git
* Neatpost: git://repo.or.cz/neatpost.git

For compiling neatroff and neatpost, modify FDIR and MDIR in their
Makefiles to point the default fonts and macros directories.  You can
use the macros that come with the Linux port of Plan 9 troff (MDIR
should point to home/tmac directory of git://repo.or.cz/troff.git).
For fonts, you can either use the fonts in the same port or use mktrfn
program to generate the output device (the latter can be obtained from
http://litcave.rudi.ir/ and supports AFM, OTF and TTF files).  FDIR
should point to the directory containing dev* subdirectories (devutf
is the default output device and hence FDIR/devutf should contain the
default device description file and set of fonts).
