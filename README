NEATROFF
========

Neatroff is an implementation of troff typesetting system in
C programming language.  Neatroff comes with its own postscript
postprocessor, neatpost.  Neatroff and neatpost can be obtained
from the following addresses:

* Neatroff: git://repo.or.cz/neatroff.git
* Neatpost: git://repo.or.cz/neatpost.git

For compiling neatroff and neatpost, modify CFLAGS in their
Makefiles to point TROFFROOT to the directory containing
output devices and macro packages; to use the devices and
macro packages of Plan 9 troff, TROFFROOT can point to the
home directory of the Linux port of Plan 9 troff
(git://repo.or.cz/troff.git).
