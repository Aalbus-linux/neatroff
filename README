NEATROFF
========

Neatroff is an implementation of troff typesetting system in C
programming language.  Neatroff comes with its own postscript
postprocessor, neatpost, and an eqn postprocessor, neateqn.  Neatroff
and its companion programs, as well as a set of standard macro
packages and an output device, can be obtained from
http://litcave.rudi.ir/.

For compiling neatroff and neatpost, modify FDIR and MDIR of their
Makefiles to point the directories containing the default output
device and macros.  For the output device, you can either use the one
available in the homepage or use the neatmkfn program to create one.
